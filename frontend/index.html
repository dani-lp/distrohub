                            Linux is an open source operating system (OS). It was originally conceived of and created as
                            a hobby by Linus Torvalds in 1991, who sought to create an alternative, free, open source
                            version of the MINIX operating system, which was itself based on the principles and design
                            of Unix. It has since become the OS with the largest user base, the most-used OS on

                            The best thing about Linux is that it's open source and released under the
                            <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html">GNU General Public License (GPL)</a>.
                            This means that anyone can run, read, modify and share the software. The open-for-all
                            policy has caused the appearance of several Linux distributions, often called
                            <i>distros.</i>

                            A distro is a complete operating system based on the Linux kernel (the core of the system).
                            Different distros have different default packages and programs preinstalled, and are
                            available for a variety of different systems, from embedded devices to personal computers.

                            acting as a reference information repository about Linux.
